# Welcome!
A few notes before you start jumping into the API...

## API Keys & API Support/Requests
For those interested in writing applications using this API, or general assistance and requests, please email <a href='mailto:api@blackfeatherproductions.com'>api@blackfeatherproductions.com</a> with information regarding your application to receive your API Key, or in the case of assistance, or feature requests for the API, please remember to provide your API key. You will receive a response within 48 hours.

## Connecting to the API/Authetication
The Extended Census Websocket uses API keys for authentication and access (which you can get from above). The API key "example" can also be used, although use of this key may be limited in the future.

1: Open a websocket connection to: ws://push.api.blackfeatherproductions.com?apikey=example

2: You will receive some messages confirming your websocket connection, and the status of Census websocket feeds.

> Connection Message

```json
{
    "service":"ps2_events",
    "version":"1.4.5",
    "websocket_event":"connectionStateChange",
    "online":"true"
}
```

3: You will also receive several ServiceStateChange messages detailing the status of census websocket feeds. More on this in the Service Events section.

> ServiceState Messages.

```json
{
    "payload":
    {
        "online":"1",
        "world_id":"2002"
    },
    "event_type":"ServiceStateChange"
}
```
4: Send messages to the server using the actions, events and filters listed below as a guideline.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](http://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
